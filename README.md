Machine Learning Workshop
=========================

One of the biggest challenges in a technical workshop is getting all the development environments setup to a point where we can all follow along.

This document will attempt to provide enough information to make sure you can set everything up before the actual workshop. 

For support during the setup proccess, please join this slack channel: https://psapps.slack.com/archives/C8R129GRK

For this workshop we will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Ideally we would use [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) but this is [not currently supported on Windows](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/494) and due to the high usage of Windows in this group, we will go with Tensorflow, which is also an amazing framework. 

## Setup instructions

For the instructions here, I am trying to keep it simple and will install things from scratch, step by step. If you are feeling adventurous or are comfortable with python already, a tool called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) can make a lot of this stuff easier to do as it installs somme of the things we need automatically. I am avoiding that here and keeping the instuctions as basic as possible. 

### 1. Install Python

#### Linux or OSX

If you are on Linux or OSX, try to ensure you are using Python 3 or, even better, skip to the 'Install Tensorflow' step and install with virtaalenv!

#### Windows

For Windows, install this: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/

You can download the installer from here (assuming everyone has 64 bit windows at this stage): https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3-amd64.exe

Just do the default installation but also select 'Add Python to Path' to save you having to do it yourself.

Crack open a fresh terminal (not one you had open before installing Python).

The following assumes you are using the good old `cmd` [terminal on Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe). Going with this as it's the one we can be sure everybody has.

If you use Powershell, this should all work too. If you are using bash for windows, you are probably better off looking at the Ubuntu installation of Tensorflow. I haven't tried this though so you will be on your own with that. 

Type `python`

You should see something like:

```
Python 3.6.3 (v3.6.3:2c5fed8, Oct  3 2017, 18:11:49) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You're in the [Interactive Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html).

Type `exit()` to leave Python. 


### 2. Install Tensorflow

There are really good instructions on how to proceed here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install

I recommend you install the CPU Only version. 

##### What I did:

To support what will most likely be the most troublesome setup, I will be using Windows for the workshop. What follows are exactly the steps I took to install Tensorflow. I am using the Windows `cmd` [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe).


Once you have installed Python in step 1, you will have a program called `pip3` now available in your terminal. To install Tensorflow run `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow`

For me that looked like this:

```
C:\Users\obrier6>pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

Validating the install:

```

>>> print(sess.run(hello))
b'Hello, TensorFlow!
```

You may have noticed this warning:

Don't worry about it. It could be a problem when building a production system where performance is important but for this workshop it's not a problem.


### 3. Install jupyter

We will use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to run our code in 'notebooks'. Notebooks allow you to essentially write and run code in a browser through an application being served locally. You can mix markdown, to document what you are doing, with runnable python code that you execute right there in the notebook. It's a really great tool. While you could keep your code in normal python scripts and build your ML applications like any normal application, in my experience, most ML applicaions begin as a notebook and only become 'real applications/services' if there's a very good reason for it. 

The installation instructons [on the jupyter site](https://jupyter.org/install) are very straight forward. 

This is what I did: 

`pip3 install jupyter`

Verifing the install:

`jupyter notebook`

This should open a browser window that will list any files in the directory you ran the command from.

### 4. Install a bunch of libraries

We will use a few python libraries in this workshop. To be able to import them in to your scripts and notebooks, you need to install them. If you used Anaconda, then these are probably already installed but if not, use pip to install them by copying and running this command:

```
pip3 install --upgrade scikit-learn numpy pandas scipy h5py pillow matplotlib python-gflags ipython
```

> Note, if you are using Linux and virtualenv,fire up the tensorflow virtualenv before installing the libraries (usually by running `source source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate`). Your prompt should change to look something like `(tensorflow)$`

### 5. Run the checklist notebook

In your command line terminal, make sure you are in the root of this repository. So if you dowloaded this repository to a folder called 'Dev' in your home folder `cd %userprofile%\Dev\ml-workshop` (on Windows) or `cd ~\Dev\ml-workshop`. 

Run jupyter notebook

`jupyter notebook`

A browser window listing the contents of the repository should be visible.

Click in to checklist.ipynb and follow the instructions there.

You should be all set now. See you at the workshop!
